	4. Iteration Management
Our development was divided into three iterations , each iteration being a bit more complex than the last. In the first iteration, we concentrated on implementing the login functionality and creating the initial forms for event creation. This allowed us to establish the basic authentication flow and ensure that users could submit event-related data correctly. In the second iteration, we built the team management module and refined event behavior, such as linking events to teams and managing their interactions. Finally, in the third iteration, we developed the frontend interface and connected it to the backend through API integrations. This helped us test the complete workflow from user actions on the interface to database responses, ensuring that all components worked together seamlessly.


5. Test-Driven Pair-Programming
We followed a test-driven pair programming approach by first writing small example tests for our database and user operations. To begin, we broke down the system into controllers and models. The models are Users (employees,events,teams etc) and the controllers are responsible for each of the use cases. Based on this plan, we wrote tests to verify the basic functionality of each part. All these controllers have corresponding tests defined for them. Once the tests were defined, we started implementing the classes and functions step by step. Every time a piece of code was ready, we ran the tests to see if it behaved as expected. If the tests failed, we debugged and refined the implementation until everything passed. Throughout this process, both members of the team contributed equally to writing, testing, and debugging the code.
6. Applied Refactoring 
At the beginning, we implemented all the routes and logic within a single file, which quickly became messy and difficult to manage as the project grew. During the latter part of the second iteration, we decided to refactor the codebase by separating concerns into modules, controllers, and routers. This restructuring made the code much cleaner and easier to maintain, while also improving collaboration between team members. Each module was assigned a specific responsibility, and the router files were used to organize the API endpoints systematically. This refactoring process significantly improved readability, scalability, and debugging efficiency.

	Participants 
	Singvalliyappa, Ahsan, Sakibul
	Meeting Notes 
	   1. Summary of our activities in previous day: 
a. Finished creating the initial database tables for financial requests and set up basic UI wireframes.
b. Reviewed last week’s flow to confirm all financial user stories are covered in our backend schema.
      2. Today expected actions:
a. We’ll start developing the Finance Manager user and connect it to the backend authentication logic.
b. We’ll refine the financial request page UI to match the wireframe, and link it to our database.
      3. Problems:
a. We found a bug in the form validation script. It isn’t saving all fields correctly, so it needs debugging before testing.
	Comments
	Expected outcome for today: Ensure every financial request is thoroughly analyzed and that teams receive clear instructions on submission standards. Aim for better consistency and fewer errors tomorrow.
	9. Conclusion
The realization of this project demonstrates how the principles of Extreme Programming (XP) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) can streamline system implementation and improve clarity throughout the development process. By focusing on small iterations, frequent testing, and continuous feedback, the XP and TDD approaches allowed us to build a functional event management workflow system that is both reliable and easy to refine. Compared to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, which emphasizes complex relationships between classes and higher abstraction, XP promotes simplicity and direct collaboration, making the system easier to understand and adapt during rapid development. Through systematic testing and incremental realization, the project achieved its objectives efficiently, ensuring functionality, maintainability, and user satisfaction.
10. Setup and Execution Instructions
This system consists of two main components:
